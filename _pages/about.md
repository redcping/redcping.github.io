# About Me

I am a **Researcher** at the *Data Science & AI Research Institute, China Unicom*.  
I received my M.S. degree in Computer Science and Technology from *Southwest Jiaotong University* in 2018, advised by **Prof. Xun Gong**.  
Before joining China Unicom, I gained industrial experience at iQIYI and Great Wall Motor .  

My research interests include:  
- Video **2D-to-3D conversion**  
- **2D/3D visual recognition** and reconstruction  
- **Image/Video generation**  
- **AI for healthcare**  

I have published papers at top-tier conferences such as **CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ACM MM and EMNLP**.
